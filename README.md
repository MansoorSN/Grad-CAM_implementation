# Grad-CAM_implementation

[Grad-CAM implementation in Keras](https://github.com/MansoorSN/Deep_Learning/blob/master/Grad_CAM_implementation_in_VGG16.ipynb). This implementaion is based on the concept introduced in the paper [Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391) fro providing visual explanations for deep learning based computer vision models.
